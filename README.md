# LoRA Brand Assistant

[![CI](https://github.com/Amatya27/BrandPilot/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Amatya27/BrandPilot/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

This project turns your notebook prototype into a cleaner LoRA + RAG workflow for brand outreach.

The goal is:

- input a company name
- optionally input a target person at that company
- search the public web for current marketing signals
- identify likely audience and marketing gaps
- generate a collaboration email and an Instagram post idea
- keep LoRA for structure and style
- keep RAG for current facts

## What is in this repo now

- `run_brand_assistant.py`
  End-to-end CLI for retrieval plus generation.
- `brand_assistant_rag.py`
  Web search, extraction, passage scoring, and prompt building.
- `brand_assistant_keras_backend.py`
  Uses your existing Keras Gemma LoRA checkpoint.
- `brand_assistant_openai_backend.py`
  Talks to a local OpenAI-compatible server such as `mlx_lm.server`.
- `prepare_mlx_dataset.py`
  Converts your old Colab JSONL dataset into MLX-LM training files.
- `brand_assistant_checkpoint.py`
  Finds and inspects your Keras checkpoint files.
- `brand_assistant_service.py`
  Reusable service layer that powers the web app.
- `app.py`
  FastAPI server for the interactive frontend.
- `webapp/`
  Static frontend files for the browser UI.

## Recommended architecture

Use this as a two-stage system:

1. Retrieval
   Search the web and collect evidence.
2. Generation
   Feed compact evidence into a LoRA-tuned Gemma model that returns strict JSON.

This keeps current facts in RAG and keeps style and structure in LoRA.

## Which model path should you use

### Path 1: Use your current Keras checkpoint

Use this if you want to work with the checkpoint files already in this folder:

- `lora_weights.weights.h5`
- `lora_weights_fixed.weights.h5`

This is the fastest way to reuse your old training.

### Path 2: Best local Mac M4 path

Use MLX-LM with a quantized Gemma 3 1B model and LoRA or QLoRA.

Recommended local base model:

- `mlx-community/gemma-3-1b-it-qat-4bit`

Why:

- designed for MLX
- small enough for local work
- strong quality for its size
- quantized for lower memory use
- works well with LoRA training in `mlx-lm`

## Beginner guide

## Part 1: Create a clean Python environment

I strongly recommend Python `3.11` for the smoothest setup on Mac.

### Option A: Conda

This is the best option for your machine if you already see `(base)` in your terminal prompt.

```bash
conda create -n lora-brand-assistant python=3.11 -y
conda activate lora-brand-assistant
```

### Option B: Standard venv

```bash
python3.11 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

If `python3.11` is not installed:

```bash
brew install python@3.11
```

## Part 2: Install the lightweight RAG dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements-local.txt
```

This gives you the free search backend.

## Part 3: Test retrieval only

This step does not need your model yet. It only tests the RAG side.

```bash
python run_brand_assistant.py \
  --backend rag-only \
  --company "Nike" \
  --person "Director of Brand Marketing"
```

Expected result:

- a research packet is saved in `outputs/`
- the packet contains search sources, evidence passages, and a grounded prompt

## Part 4: Run with your current Keras checkpoint

This path reuses your existing LoRA weights.

### 4A. Install Keras dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements-keras.txt
```

If Keras later complains about the backend on macOS, install JAX separately and follow Apple’s `jax-metal` setup guide. If you want the smoother local path on a Mac M4, skip to Part 5 and use MLX-LM instead.

### 4B. Set Kaggle credentials

KerasHub built-in Gemma presets use Kaggle-hosted assets.

Best secure permanent option:

Store Kaggle's credential file at `~/.kaggle/kaggle.json` and lock down the permissions.

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.kaggle
mv ~/Downloads/kaggle.json ~/.kaggle/kaggle.json
chmod 600 ~/.kaggle/kaggle.json
```

The Keras backend in this project will automatically read that file if `KAGGLE_USERNAME` and `KAGGLE_KEY` are not already set.

You can also do this for just the current terminal session:

```bash
export KAGGLE_USERNAME="your_kaggle_username"
export KAGGLE_KEY="your_kaggle_key"
```

You can find these values by signing in to Kaggle, opening `Settings`, and creating a new API token. Kaggle will download a `kaggle.json` file that contains both values.

If you want the variables to persist every time you open Terminal, add them to your `~/.zshrc` file:

```bash
echo 'export KAGGLE_USERNAME="your_kaggle_username"' >> ~/.zshrc
echo 'export KAGGLE_KEY="your_kaggle_key"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

### 4C. Run the assistant

```bash
python run_brand_assistant.py \
  --backend keras \
  --company "Nike" \
  --person "Director of Brand Marketing"
```

If you see a `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'jax'`, install the JAX backend:

```bash
pip install jax
```

For Apple Silicon GPU acceleration, also install:

```bash
xcode-select --install
pip install jax-metal
```

Notes:

- the script will prefer `lora_weights_fixed.weights.h5` if it exists
- if no fixed file exists, it falls back to `lora_weights.weights.h5`
- the code tries to infer the LoRA rank from the checkpoint

## Part 4.5: Run the Interactive App

This is the easiest way to use the project day to day.

### 4.5A. Install app dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements-app.txt
```

### 4.5B. Start the app

```bash
./run_app.sh
```

This launcher script:

- activates the `lora-brand-assistant` Conda environment
- switches into the project folder automatically
- clears an older app process on port `8010` if one is already running
- starts the FastAPI app with the right backend settings

### 4.5C. Open it in your browser

```bash
open http://127.0.0.1:8010
```

What the app does:

- takes a company name and optional person or role
- runs live RAG over the public web
- looks up official company links when possible
- generates a structured brand brief using your Gemma LoRA checkpoint
- shows source links next to each gap so you can fact-check the result

If you want to change the backend later, you can start the app with environment variables:

```bash
export BRAND_ASSISTANT_BACKEND=keras
./run_app.sh
```

Or for an OpenAI-compatible local server:

```bash
export BRAND_ASSISTANT_BACKEND=openai-compatible
export BRAND_ASSISTANT_API_BASE=http://localhost:8080/v1
export BRAND_ASSISTANT_MODEL=mlx-community/gemma-3-1b-it-qat-4bit
./run_app.sh
```

## Part 5: Best local Mac workflow with MLX-LM

This is the path I recommend for a production-quality local setup on your Mac M4.

### 5A. Install MLX-LM

```bash
pip install "mlx-lm[train]"
```

### 5B. Convert your old dataset into MLX-LM format

Replace the input path with the JSONL file you used in Colab.

```bash
python prepare_mlx_dataset.py \
  --input /path/to/brand_outreach_clean_v2.jsonl \
  --output-dir data/mlx_brand_assistant
```

This creates:

- `data/mlx_brand_assistant/train.jsonl`
- `data/mlx_brand_assistant/valid.jsonl`
- `data/mlx_brand_assistant/test.jsonl`

### 5C. Train a local QLoRA adapter

```bash
mlx_lm.lora \
  --model mlx-community/gemma-3-1b-it-qat-4bit \
  --train \
  --data data/mlx_brand_assistant \
  --iters 600 \
  --batch-size 1 \
  --learning-rate 1e-5 \
  --mask-prompt \
  --adapter-path adapters/brand_assistant_1b_qat
```

What this does:

- uses a 4-bit Gemma 3 1B base model
- trains a QLoRA adapter
- computes loss on the completion instead of the prompt
- saves adapters into `adapters/brand_assistant_1b_qat`

### 5D. Start a local MLX server

Open a second terminal window:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
mlx_lm.server --model mlx-community/gemma-3-1b-it-qat-4bit
```

By default the server runs at `http://localhost:8080/v1`.

Use the same working directory when you later pass `--adapter-path`, because the MLX server expects that adapter path to be relative to where the server was started.

### 5E. Run the assistant against your local MLX server

Back in your first terminal:

```bash
python run_brand_assistant.py \
  --backend openai-compatible \
  --api-base http://localhost:8080/v1 \
  --model mlx-community/gemma-3-1b-it-qat-4bit \
  --adapter-path adapters/brand_assistant_1b_qat \
  --company "Nike" \
  --person "Director of Brand Marketing"
```

This uses:

- free public-web retrieval from `ddgs`
- your local Gemma 3 1B QLoRA adapter for generation

## Part 6: Run the app with Docker

The web app (FastAPI + the RAG pipeline) runs in a container. The fine-tuned Gemma model keeps running on the Mac through `mlx_lm.server`, because MLX needs Apple's GPU, which Docker containers cannot use. The container reaches the model server at `host.docker.internal:8080`.

### 6A. Start the model server on the Mac

```bash
conda activate lora-brand-assistant
mlx_lm.server --model mlx-community/gemma-3-1b-it-qat-4bit --port 8080
# add --adapter-path adapters to serve your LoRA adapter
```

### 6B. Build and start the app container

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

Open `http://localhost:8010`. Health check: `http://localhost:8010/api/health`.

Generated packets and results are written to `./outputs` on your machine.

### 6C. Stop it

```bash
docker compose down
```

### What the Docker setup does

- `Dockerfile`: Python 3.11 slim image; installs dependencies in their own layer so code edits rebuild fast; runs as a non-root user; includes a health check on `/api/health`.
- `docker-compose.yml`: maps port 8010, points the app at the host's model server, and mounts `./outputs` so results survive container restarts.
- `.dockerignore`: keeps model weights, adapters, caches and credentials (`kaggle.json`, `.env`) out of the image.

If the app cannot reach the model, start the server with `--host 0.0.0.0` so the container can connect to it.

## Part 7: Tests and continuous integration

Unit tests cover the JSON output parser and validator, the retrieval helpers (chunking, company matching, query building) and the API (health check, input validation, unknown jobs). They need no model and no network.

```bash
pip install -r requirements-app.txt -r requirements-local.txt -r requirements-dev.txt
pytest -q
```

Every push runs GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`): it installs dependencies, runs the tests, builds the Docker image and smoke-tests the running container through `/api/health`.

## Output format

The generator is asked to return strict JSON with:

- `brand_summary`
- `likely_target_audience`
- `current_marketing_strategy`
- `marketing_gaps`
- `instagram_post_idea`
- `email_subject`
- `email_body`
- `citations`

This is much better than the old plain-text section format because it is easier to validate and use in a real app.

## Why your old outputs were getting cut off

Your notebook trained and generated at `512` tokens total, while the prompt itself was already long.

The new code improves this by:

- using a compact evidence packet
- using JSON instead of long prose sections
- fitting the prompt to a higher sequence length
- reserving completion budget for the final answer

## Important reality check

This repo is now much closer to a runnable software project than the original notebook, but there are still two practical limits:

1. I did not fully run Gemma inference in this environment.
   This machine does not already have the full Gemma runtime and credentials configured here.
2. Your existing `.h5` checkpoints are Keras checkpoints, not MLX adapters.
   So the best local Mac path still means retraining LoRA in MLX-LM from your dataset.

That is the cleanest path if your goal is a strong local Mac M4 deployment.

## Useful commands

Inspect retrieval only:

```bash
python run_brand_assistant.py --backend rag-only --company "Airbnb"
```

Use your existing Keras checkpoint:

```bash
python run_brand_assistant.py --backend keras --company "Airbnb"
```

Use the interactive web app:

```bash
python -m uvicorn app:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8010
```

Use your local MLX server and adapter:

```bash
python run_brand_assistant.py \
  --backend openai-compatible \
  --api-base http://localhost:8080/v1 \
  --model mlx-community/gemma-3-1b-it-qat-4bit \
  --adapter-path adapters/brand_assistant_1b_qat \
  --company "Airbnb"
```
